# Seven Simple Apps Handbook

## How we work

- Monday to Thursday; Friday off.
- Min 2 hours/day; not more than 4 hours/day.
- Three-week cycles to do scheduled work (first three weeks of the month)
- After each three-week cycle, we schedule one week for cool-down to work on random things we like (last week of the month)
- We draw some ideas on product development from Shape Up book by Basecamp. Everyone is expected to read it some shape of form. (let's be honest, I (Rinas) haven't read it from cover to cover yet but I often refer to it for ideas on how to tackle a specific problem).
- Asynchronous communication in Basecamp.
